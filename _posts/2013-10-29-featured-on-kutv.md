EnjiGo was recently (featured on KUTV)[http://www.kutv.com/news/top-stories/stories/vid_7480.shtml]! Joel Cooper, Ian King and myself (Duane Johnson) were part of the interview. There were some sumo bots from Michael Anderson's class in the b-roll, as well as gratuitous drills and CNC machines. Thanks KUTV!
