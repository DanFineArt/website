We'll have our next public meeting on Wednesday, June 5th at 7:00 PM. Come and see what we're making!

If you have a project to show, or an announcement to make, just show up and tell us what you've got.

Also, on the *following* wednesday (June 12th) we'll be having a special show-and-tell night with a photographer (i.e. whoever has a camera). We'll be publishing photos on our enjigo.com website to give others a clearer idea of what we're working on. If you have a visually interesting project, please bring it along! We'd love to see any cool things that are in a finished or semi-finished state. :)
