Since we opened the doors in May, we've been holding public meetings every Wednesday. New people get to see the space and members typically show the space off and do a tour. Ideally, what we'd like to do on Wednesdays is get together and hack some things together, and many members feel that it would be better to use most Wednesdays to build things worthy of showing off, and just a few Wednesdays to show off the space to new potential members.

To that end, we've changed the calendar to reflect that some Wednesday evenings are for getting together to build stuff, while others are for general public tours with an emphasis on showing off cool stuff members have been working on. Our next public meeting will be August 7th, at 7:00 PM. Come see!
