On June 12th (7PM to 10PM) we're holding a special public night for showing off our projects. We'd like to improve the website and to do so, we think we need to give people a glimpse of the kinds of things we work on and what to expect from the community.

I've seen some pretty awesome stuff going on, from CoAction OS, to tinkering with individually addressable LED light strips; from the Benki internet-of-things project to low cost arduino boards from Elefu. Come show off what you're up to and be on our website!
