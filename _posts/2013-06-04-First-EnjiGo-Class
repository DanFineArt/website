**Introducing the Arduino Game Maker Class ($130 total)**

Let's make an Arduino microcontroller into a little hand-held gaming machine! In 4 weeks, you'll learn to solder and build your own game hardware--we'll use a full color mini LCD display and a Teensy 3.0 (Arduino-compatible) microcontroller as the core, and you can add peripherals like knobs and switches.

Each week, you'll come away with a working game (Musical Lights, Simon, Pong, and Etch-a-sketch) on your new upgraded hardware. You'll also learn some programming basics by starting with a working game and then modifying and improving it. On your final week, if you'd like to start building your own game instead of Etch-a-sketch, feel free! Get as far as you can that evening and come back later for help from the community (membership is $50 per month).

**Summary:**

- The class is 4 weeks long
- Using your Arduino, you'll come away with a different video game each week
- Cost of materials is $50 (microcontroller, LCD panel, circuit board, batteries, etc.)
- Each class is $20, 4 classes total (classes are free to EnjiGo members)
- We meet each Tuesday at 7:00 PM
- There is a "catch up" lab on Wednesday nights at 8:00 PM
- Bring your own laptop, or use one supplied by the space. We'll use our computers to program the Arduino-compatible microcontrollers.

**Class 1: Intro**

- GAME: Musical Lights
- get the Arduino Game kit [1]
- demo working games
- learn how to program the Teensy microcontroller using the Arduino IDE
  - connect Teensy to Arduino IDE, load BLINK program
- connect battery pack to Teensy

**Class 2: Soldering**

- GAME: Simon
- solder to board:
  - headers for Teensy
  - RGB Color LED
  - wiring to connect LED to Teensy
  - 4 buttons & 4 resistors
  - wiring to connect buttons & resistors to Teensy
- load SIMON program
- tweak it to make it more fun?

**Class 3: Programming**

- GAME: Pong
- solder to board:
  - headers for LCD panel
  - wiring to connect LCD panel to Teensy
  - 2 potentiometers (aka dial, knob)
  - wiring to connect potentiometers
- load ONE-PLAYER-PONG program
- can you write two player pong?

**Class 4: To Infinity and Beyond**

- GAME (pick one):
  - Etch-a-sketch
  - Your own game*
- load MONOCHROME-ETCH-A-SKETCH
- can you make a color Etch-a-sketch program? make it more fun?
- *write your own game (with some help if you need it)
