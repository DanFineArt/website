Our first public meeting was pretty awesome. Tyler Gilbert, a local microcontroller operating system author, demoed his CoActionOS software and the corresponding CoAction Hero that he's been building for the past 3 years. What's really cool is that he has a (kickstarter campaign)[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/966383008/coaction-hero-32-bit-open-source-arm-cortex-m3-boa] going on right now that you should totally support!

We'll have our 2nd public meeting this Wednesday at 7:00 PM. Come and see what we're making!

If you have a project to show, or an announcement to make, just show up and tell us what you've got. It'll be fun to see what everyone is working on!
