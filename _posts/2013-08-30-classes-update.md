## Classes Update

We have some neat classes planned for September and October. Build your own 3D printer, make a microcontroller gameboy (Game Making on the Arduino Platform), and a battle robot class. There will be more details soon, but for now, if you're interested let members know on the [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.enjigo.com/) and it will help us prioritize. Oh, and ideas for classes are always welcome--whether you want to learn about it or teach it!
