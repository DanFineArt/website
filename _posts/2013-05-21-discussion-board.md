Hey, we have a discussion board now:

[http://discuss.enjigo.com/](http://discuss.enjigo.com/)

It uses the fantastic new software called Discourse from the same guys that built Stack Overflow.

We're hosting it on DigitalOcean right now, too, which has been an interesting discovery. They have the cheapest cloud hosting I've ever seen... is that a good thing? Also, backups.

YES.
