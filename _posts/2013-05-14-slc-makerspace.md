Well, here we are. EnjiGo is a thing. We're a non-profit foundation ("EnjiGo Foundation") creating a makerspace in Salt Lake City for engineers, artists, and anyone who wants to make, hack and craft.

We just entered a 3-year lease with Joben Property to use the Wright Building on 30 East Kensington Ave (it's between State and Main, at 15th South in SLC). The building is awesome for what we plan on doing--it has a 3000 sq ft warehouse with 18ft ceiling, a club room with pool table and juke box, a retail space with a window in the front for showing off the cool stuff people build (robots, art projects, etc.), and a spacious room upstairs for a classroom with a lot of natural light. In addition, we have some office space for people who want to co-work or rent desk space that will help support the lease commitment.

The space is perfect for our 3 goals:
* Education
* Collaborative Creation
* Hardware Entrepreneurship

The classroom is a great spot for holding user group meetings, teaching kids and adults, and just finding a temporary space to work with tables and chairs.

The warehouse is HUGE and is in great shape, too. There's a metal bench along one entire wall, and space for our (future) laser cutter and milling machines. We also plan on setting up more space for collaborative creation there--probably some desks and chairs for instance.

There are 2 or 3 rooms that are being rented out in part by people who want a more "permanent" desk space so they can keep their stuff and come back often to further their projects. Desks are $200 per month. The setup is perfect for young hardware entrepreneurs who are just getting their feet on the ground--if you want to develop your stuff alongside other experts in niche electronics fields like arduinos, microcontrollers, PCBs, or Raspberry Pis, it's an optimal arrangement.
