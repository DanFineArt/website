Some people have asked about whether or not EnjiGo offers discounts in exchange for advance payment of membership dues. The board recently voted on the issue and decided that if anyone is willing to pay for 5 months up front, they can get the 6th month free. (So $250 gets you 6 months of Membership, $1000 gets you 6 months of Desk Membership. See <a href="/join.html">How to Join</a>)

We have some great supporters of the space who have gone ahead and done this and I just wanted to say thanks to those who believe in the idea of a community makerspace and are willing to put their money on the line to make it real. Brad Midgley, Dan Mitchell, Victor Lee, and others. Thank you for believing in the value of the space and for paying membership dues 6 or 12 months in advance!
