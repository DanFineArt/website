Our first graphics class is going to be running Monday's 6-8pm from Nov 11 through Dec 9th.

This course covers an introduction to vector and raster graphics manipulated with Inkscape and GIMP (both are free, open source tools that run on most common operating systems).  During class students will learn the basics of generating graphics for both web and print end products.  In addition we will be covering printing conventions and methods for preparing files to send to print.  Our goal is for students to walk away with the skills to create: post cards, flyers, posters, print ads and simple web graphics.

Please bring a personal computer that you are comfortable using.   Part of the course will involve setting up the Inkscape and GIMP on your own computer.
