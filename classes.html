      <h3>PayPal</h3>
      <p>Another option is PayPal, but we ask you to add $5 as a convenience fee since the transaction cost is higher. The advantage to PayPal is you can use a credit card, and it's been around longer so maybe you already have an account set up. To sign up:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Subscribe via PayPal for a monthly membership (see options on the right, or below)</li>
      <li>Come to our space on Public Night (Wednesday 7:00 PM)</li>
      <li>Sign the waiver</li>
