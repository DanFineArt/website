      <p>Well, here we are. EnjiGo is a thing.</p>

      <blockquote>The EnjiGo Foundation is a nonprofit community space for education, collaboration and idea incubation in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. We teach classes, and operate a machine shop with a variety of prototyping tools. We welcome the curious, the beginner, the expert, the young, and the old to join us to make, hack, or craft something amazing.</blockquote>

      <p>This nonprofit foundation is the merger of several Salt Lake City maker groups including MakeSLC (founded in 2010) and Robot Fanatics (founded in 2012). In March 2013, members from these organizations met to discuss a merger. At that time, they believed that joining together would bring better access to tools, an attractive meeting location, and a stronger community. And now, here we are! The EnjiGo Foundation was formed in May 2013 to serve the community in that capacity.</p>

      <p>We just entered a 3-year lease with Joben Property (as of May 2013) to use the Wright Building on <a href="/map.html">30 East Kensington Ave [google map]</a> (it's between State and Main, at 15th South in SLC). The building is awesome for what we plan on doing--it has a 3000 sq ft warehouse with 18ft ceiling, a club room with pool table and juke box, a retail space with a window in the front for showing off the cool stuff people build (robots, art projects, etc.), and a spacious room upstairs for a classroom with a lot of natural light. In addition, we have some office space for people who want to co-work or rent desk space that will help support the lease commitment.</p>

      <p>The space is perfect for our 3 goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Collaborative Creation</li>
        <li>Idea Incubation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The classroom is a great spot for holding user group meetings, teaching kids and adults, and just finding a temporary space to work with tables and chairs.</p>

      <p>The warehouse is HUGE and is in great shape, too. There's a metal bench along one entire wall, and space for our 3D printers, CNC router and (future) laser cutter. We also plan on setting up more space for collaborative creation there--probably some desks and chairs for instance.</p>

      <p>Membership at the space is $50 per month (see <a href="/join.html">How to Join</a>). There are 2 or 3 rooms that are being rented out in part by people who want a more "permanent" desk space so they can keep their stuff and come back often to further their projects. Desks are $200 per month. The setup is perfect for young hardware entrepreneurs who are just getting their feet on the ground--if you want to develop your stuff alongside other experts in niche electronics fields like arduinos, microcontrollers, PCBs, or Raspberry Pis, it's an optimal arrangement.</p>

      <p>We're so excited to be here and to be a part of the Salt Lake City maker community. Come check us out on a Wednesday evening, or join in the conversation at <a href="http://discuss.enjigo.com">discuss.enjigo.com</a>. Welcome!</p>
