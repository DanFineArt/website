<h2>Payment Methods</h2>

<p>Our preferred method of payment is Dwolla, since transaction fees are so low. To sign up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send $50 (or $200 for Desk Membership) via Dwolla to #812-564-7607</li>
<li>Come to our space on Public Night (Wednesday 7:00 PM)</li>
<li>Sign the waiver</li>
<li>Get your key fob [coming soon]</li>
</ul>

Another option is PayPal, but we ask you to add $5 as a convenience fee since the transaction cost is higher. The advantage to PayPal is you can use a credit card, and it's been around longer so maybe you already have an account set up. To sign up:

<ul>
<li>Send $55 (or $205 for Desk Membership) via PayPal to enjigo.treasurer@gmail.com</li>
<li>Come to our space on Public Night (Wednesday 7:00 PM)</li>
<li>Sign the waiver</li>
<li>Get your key fob [coming soon]</li>
</ul>

Last but not least, we do accept checks in person if neither of the above methods work.
