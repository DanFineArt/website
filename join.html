Payment Methods
===============

Our preferred method of payment is Dwolla, since transaction fees are so low. To sign up:

- Send $50 via Dwolla to #812-564-7607
- Come to our space on Public Night (Wednesday 7:00 PM)
- Sign the waiver
- Get your key fob [coming soon]

Another option is PayPal, but we ask you to add $5 as a convenience fee since the transaction cost is higher. The advantage to PayPal is you can use a credit card, and it's been around longer so maybe you already have an account set up. To sign up:

- Send $55 via PayPal to enjigo.treasurer@gmail.com
- Come to our space on Public Night (Wednesday 7:00 PM)
- Sign the waiver
- Get your key fob [coming soon]

Last but not least, we do accept checks in person if neither of the above methods work.
